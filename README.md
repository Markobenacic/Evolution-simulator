# Evolution simulator
Simple organism evolution simulator made using neural networks.
Neural networks are optimised using an evolution genetic algorithm.
Visualisation made using StdDraw library (I did not make that library).
Needs la4j imported to work properly (lightweight library for linear algebra operations in java).
